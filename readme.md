# Prompt Engineering with Llama 2

IN COLLABORATION WITH Meta

## What youâ€™ll learn in this course

Open up your prompt engineering to the Llama 2 collection of models! Learn best practices for prompting and building applications with these powerful open commercial license models.

Interact with the entire collection of Llama 2 models with a simple API call, and explore the differences in output between models for a variety of tasks.

What you'll do: 

* Learn best practices for prompting and selecting among the Llama 2 models by using them as a personal assistant to help you complete day-to-day tasks.
* Experiment with advanced prompt engineering techniques, like few-shot prompting to get Llama 2 to classify the sentiment of text messages, and chain-of-thought prompting to solve logic problems.
* Treat Code Llama as a pair programming partner to both learn to write and improve code.
* Promote safe and responsible use of LLMs by having Llama Guard check user prompts and model responses for harmful content.

Llama 2 models and model weights are free to download, including quantized model versions that can run on your local machine. Join a thriving community of open source developers that is building applications powered by Llama 2.

## Who should join?

Anyone who is interested in learning prompt engineering and wants to try out Meta Llama 2 models.
